# Sequencing pipelines
Workflow today:
- Setup (notebook, environment and files)
- Create index from reference and align sequence to it. Then optimize this allgnment.
- Finding mutations (step by step)
- Finding mutations with `breseq` (premade pipeline)
- De novo genome assembly (assembly without a reference)
