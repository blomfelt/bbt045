## Quality control and filtering
[[He-2020-Assessing the Impact of Data Preprocessing on Analyzing Next Generation Sequencing Data.pdf]]

In this text I would like you to focus on the outcome of the study:
    - _Which tools are better for data processing, and which tools are equivalent?_
    - _How much does the choice of filtering tools affect the end result?_
    - _What could that mean for your projects?_

## Mapping
[[Schbath-2012-Mapping Reads on a Genomic Sequence.pdf]]

Read the overview of the algorithms, particularly focusing on:
-  2.1 Hashing
- 2.2 Burrows-Wheeler alignments

What can you learn from the tool evaluation in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8?

What from this study can you put to use in your projects?
